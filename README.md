# Exploratory Data Analysis of Car Features and Pricing Dataset

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world car features and pricing dataset.  
The goal is to analyze vehicle specifications, performance metrics, and understand the key factors influencing car prices (MSRP).

This project is designed as an **interview-ready EDA mini project** for Data Science and AI/ML roles.
